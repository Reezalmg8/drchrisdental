            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              While travelling around the BDC roundabout, renamed the Kenyalang Roundabout, on a warm Saturday afternoon in December 2005, Dr. Christina spotted a vacated shop-lot upstairs of the then Nissan car showroom. She contacted the owner, and Dr. Christina's Dental Clinic was officially established on the 6th of June, 2006. The Nissan car showroom has since become Jee Kwong Optical Group's.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Dr. Chris, as she is fondly known, hails from Kajang, a West Malaysian town located in the State of Selangor. She received a Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) degree from the University of Malaya in 1995. Since then, she has served as a dentist at various private dental clinics throughout West Malaysia before moving to Kuching, Sarawak.
